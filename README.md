# FafeDetected
The FaceDetcted app in Windows Forms detects faces in images using Haar cascades. Users select an image, and faces are highlighted with rectangles. It offers face cropping, image saving, and counts detected faces, saving the count with the date to a text file. Built with Emgu.CV libraries.
